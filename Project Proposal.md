## Project Proposal

#### 1. Problem re-clarification

When buyers are asked to describe their dream home, they always don't start with the height of the ceiling in the basement or the proximity of the east-west rail line. But real data set on home prices shows that it's not just the number of bedrooms or whitewashed fences that influence price negotiations. Thus, it is important to figure out an efficient model to predict house price based on various features that some of them we won't even consider while selecting a house.

We obtain the Iowa Ames house price dataset from Dean De Cock (Truman State University), which contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Our goal is to determine the information of this dataset and predict the final price of each home.

#### 2. Method & Question

We plan to use advanced regression methods such as Ridge Regression and Ada-Boost to fit the features of the dataset, before this process, we also need to do the data cleaning. Then we compare each method (based on the RMSE value), use the most efficient model to predict the final house price. Finally, we analyze and draw conclusions about this problem.
